// reconcile schedules replication jobs to fix any discrepancies in how the expected state of the

//
// It currently handles fixing two discrepancies:
//
// 1. Assigned storage having an outdated replica of a repository. This is fixed by scheduling
//    an `update` type job from any healthy storage with an up to date replica. These are only
//    scheduled if there is no other active `update` type job targeting the outdated replica.
// 2. Unassigned storage having an unnecessary replica. This is fixed by scheduling a `delete_replica`
//    type job to remove the unneeded replica from the storage. These are only scheduled if all assigned
//    storages are up to date and the replica is not used as a source or target storage in any other job.
//    Only one job of this type is allowed to be queued for a given repository at a time. This is to avoid
//    deleting too many replicas if assignments are changed while the jobs are queued.
//
// The fixes are only scheduled if the target node is healthy, and if there is a healthy source node
// available should the job need one.
//
// If the repository has no assignments set, reconcile falls back to considering every storage in the
// virtual storage as assigned. As all storages are considered assigned if no assignments exist, no
// `delete_replica` jobs are scheduled when assignments are not explicitly set.
