# This wrapper has the single intention of catching any Git invocations via
# $PATH instead of via either our Git DSL or via `config.GitPath()`. Our tests
# are thus set up with PATH including this binary. As the binary always prints
# an error message and exits with a weird status code, tests should fail
# quickly and with a hopefully helpful message making the actual error quick to
# spot.

echo "$0 executable from \$PATH was picked up. Please fix code to use \`config.Config.Git.BinPath\` instead." >&2
