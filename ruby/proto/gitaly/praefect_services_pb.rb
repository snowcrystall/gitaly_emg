      # in the virtual storage. An error is also returned when trying to set a replication factor below one. The primary node
      # won't be unassigned as it needs a copy of the repository to accept writes. Likewise, the primary is the first storage
      # that gets assigned when setting a replication factor for a repository. Assignments of unconfigured storages are ignored.
      # This might cause the actual replication factor to be higher than desired if the replication factor is set during an upgrade
      # from a Praefect node that does not yet know about a new node. As assignments of unconfigured storages are ignored, replication
      # factor of repositories assigned to a storage node removed from the cluster is effectively decreased.
